# JS Overrides Extension

It overrides JavaScript TypeScript and TSX syntax highlighting.

### Development

1. Copy treesitter files from the zed repository languages crate into the languages directory.
2. Make changes to the copied highlights.scm files.

Note: Only copying the highlights.scm files seems not to work, that is why the full language files are needed.
